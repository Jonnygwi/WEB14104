Debugging Challenge Blog post
---
I had done a little bit of javascript before doing this debugging challenge so the usual steps to debugging code were familiar to me. I know that javascript is case sensitive so I looked for any uppercase or lowercase characters that would cause an error.

The next step would be to open the console in element inspector, a feature of chrome. Once in here I looked for any undefined errors and then go back into the code a correct these issues. When I came to a challenge that meant I had to create a funtion I looked at the code that was given to me and using it I was able to recreate similar functions that would solve the issue at hand.

When I came to the issue that meant changing a CSS property I had to use Google which was easy enough because it is a pretty simple peace of code. I search for "changing a CSS property using jQuery". Whilst trying to change the "display" property of an element I had a few issues with it not working so useing my knowledge of CSS I found a work around (using 'inherit' as opposed to 'block'). I am glad I was faced with this issue becuase I elarnt how to change the CSS properties using jQuery.

Other then this previous problem it was a pretty straight forward debugging process.
