#Hongik University

Hongik University is a Korean university that is well known for its Art and Design students/courses. Being a university that specialises in the design field I think having an inspiring website is necessary, based on the fact that this is the only form of media anyone international can get information from. I was recommended this university by a Korean friend, and if it wasn't for her reassurance I wouldn't be interested in going here. The website alone would have put me off completely. For this reason I have decided that this will be a great website to redesign.  

###Loading time
Some of the websites key design features are either loading slowely or on several attempts not loading at all, for example the header image loads in different stages. Resulting in a loss of interest.

### Visual inaccessibility

* Mystery Meat Navigation
* Recall rather than recognition
* Inconsistency
* Invisibility of system status
* Punish mistakes
* Content updatedness
