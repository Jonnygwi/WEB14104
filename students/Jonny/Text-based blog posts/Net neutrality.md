Watch The Internet's Own Boy, a film about Aaron Swartz: wiz-kid, co-founder of Reddit and activist for social justice and freedom of information.

Heads up! This will be available on BBC iPlayer until the 4th of March 2015, so you better watch it before then.

Questions that may guide your blog post (in no particular order):

How do you feel about freedom of information?
What do you think constitutes digital theft?
How do you feel about Net Neutrality?
If you had magical powers, would you use them for good or to make you mountains of cash?
