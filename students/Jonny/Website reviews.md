## [Hongik University](id:anchor1)
[Site](http://en.hongik.ac.kr/)

Hongik University is a Korean university that is well known for its Art and Design students/courses. Being a university that specialises in the design field I think having an inspiring website is necessary, based on the fact that this is the only form of media anyone international can get information from. I was recommended this university by a Korean friend, and if it wasn't for her reassurance I wouldn't be interested in going here. The website alone would have put me off completely. For this reason I have decided that this will be a great website to redesign.  

###Loading time
Some of the websites key design features are either loading slowely or on several attempts not loading at all, for example the header image loads in different stages. Resulting in a loss of interest.

### Visual inaccessibility
On every page the address and logo is at the bottom of the page, the text is really small and difficult to read. I think this is due to the address being an image and pixelating when its stretched across the footer. 

### Navigation bar that punish's mistakes
The navigation bar is in the middle of the body which is good because it is easy to navigate but it also means that it just pushed around and changes according to what page you are on as it is the same space where some content appears. I found that the menu really punishes mistakes because it is not a static menu and it changes drastically according to what page you are on. I often found when I was exploring the site I forgot how I accessed certain information, so it took me a long time to relocate it. This style of navigation bar goes against a lot of design principles of the moment which could confuse users that are not so comfortable browsing a website that they are not familiar with. I think this is a good example of a feature that goes against Jakob Neilsons principle of reducing the user's memory load and making all information available, visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. *"Recognition rather than recall"*.

###Consistency and standards
Consistency and standards is one of Jakob's ten general principles for interaction design. *"Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions."*
Although there is nothing wrong with the English that is used on this site they use a lot of phrases that are unusual which makes me they are mistakes it then leads to me questioning a lot of the other information that is given. Concidering that the information given is fairly minimal it is vital that they make the users comfortable with the information that is being given.

###Content updatedness
When inspecting element I came across a string that was commented out ( 영문홈페이지 홈페이지 작성(2002. 12. 15) 홍익대학교 홈페이지실 개발자: 김준석 디자이너: 윤상희 ) translated into english it says the site was created on the 15th of December 2002 and I am guessing it hasn't been updated since.
