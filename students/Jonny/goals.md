# Ground zero

## Goals

#### 1. Gain an understanding of `constructing a website to an industry standard`.

  
> This is a very important goal of mine because it brings me one step closer to being employable. I want to learn how to build a site in an efficient way, by that I mean where to start, what process I should be following and what questions I should be asking myself along the way. If left to my own devises Iâ€™m not sure I would go about the task in the best way. This project should help me learn good habits, a logical approach and the skills required to build a web site to an industry standard.



#### 2. Work on a project which might lead to new international connections.   


> The website for my brief is the international website for  Hongik University in Seoul, South Korea. I am very interested in the culture of the country and how web based media is developing in Asia.  I have been thinking about doing an MA at this university in "Digital Design". Depending on how the project goes I might be able to present the final product to them and ask for feedback.  Although working with a different culture and language will present many challenges for me, it could be a great way of getting myself known within the university.


#### 3. Improve my personal `project management` techniques.

> `Project management` is crucial and an area that I really want to improve on.  Setting myself a clear brief and programme, with achievable targets and ways to monitor my progress will really increase my productivity, help stay on track and keep me self motivated.   

#### 4. Improve my `aesthetic composition`.


> Improving my aesthetic composition is not a primary goal with this project but is something I am very interested in. Aesthetic composition is a broad area that I am always striving to improve.  I believe that through the process of making something that works well I will instinctively be looking at how it looks on the page.  However, I also think my aesthetic composition and judgement will develop by simply practising and by a process of trial and error. I feel I learn best from making mistakes.


#### 5. `Portfolio building`.


> Because I will be developing a fully function website this will be a perfect piece to put in my portfolio. I often see job or work opportunities but I do not have any work that are of an appropriate standard or that I am proud to showcase.  This could be a great opportunity to fix that.

#### 6. Hone my `coding capabilities`.


> This will always be a goal whether it is in one language or another but from this project I will improve my knowledge of CSS.

## Where I stand

### Strengths and weaknesses
-
> My strengths are enthusiasm and a commitment to learning but I am aware that some of my weaknesses might undermine these strengths
> These are the weaknesses that I am aware of and alongside them some practical ways that I think I might be able to overcome them in the project: 

> * Keeping focus

> 	* To help keep focus I could set myself small goals or sub-projects to achieve. I think organising a doable work plan will make a big difference to whether my project will be successful.


> * Staying motivated

> 	* Creating the right work environment is important and I think I am motivated the most when I am at college so I will be coming to college everyday to stay on the right track.

> * Staying positive and confident 

>   * Rather than getting disheartened when I find things difficult I will be realistic and get support by asking someone to look over my work and offer advice and suggest ways forward


> Hopefully at the end of this project I will be able to turn these weaknesses into strengths.

### Admiration
-

> I have a friend who is in the front end web development industry. I admire him because he learnt everything he knows and gained the contacts he has on his own.  Driven by his curiosity and a passion for his subject he has gone out on a limb and in the process achieved much.  As an individual I find it very hard to push myself out of my comfort zone and publically ask questions. I could learn a lot about getting myself heard or just simply "putting myself out there" from this guy.
