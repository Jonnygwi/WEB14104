# Ground zero

#### 1. Gain an understanding of `constructing a website to an industry standard`.

  
> This is a very important goal of mine because it brings me one step closer to being employable. I often question whether the way the I would go around building a website is inefficient, this project should hopefully answer that.

#### 2. Start of the `relationship with Hongik University` that I might be interested in doing an MA at.


> The website for my brief is the international website for [Hongik University](http://en.hongik.ac.kr/) in Seoul, Korea. I have been thinking about doing an MA at this university in "Digital Design". Depending on how the project goes I might be able to present the final product to them and see what they think. This could be a great way of getting myself known within the university.


#### 3. Personal `project management` techniques.

> `Project management` is something I really want to improve on because if it is done correctly it can greatly improve my productivity and self motivation.

#### 4. Improve my `aesthetic composition`.


> I wont be focusing on this goal because it is to broad and will be achieved by simply practising. I will be able to encourage this progression by a process of trial and error. I feel I learn best from making mistakes


#### 5. `Portfolio building`.


> Because I will be developing a fully function website this will be a perfect peice to put in my portfolio. I often see job or work opportunities but I do not have any work that I am proud of to showcase, this could be a great opportunity to fix that.


#### 6. Hone my `coding capabilities`.


> This will always be a goal whether it is in one language or another but from this project I will improve my knowledge of CSS.
