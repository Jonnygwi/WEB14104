Setting up wordpress locally
---
[I used this guide](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP)

Setting up Wordpress locally was pretty straightforward if you have a guide on how to do it.

I encountered something that was not mentioned in the guide. We had to create an account that would have access to the database and to do thisI just used common sense to work out where the accounts tab was, it happened to be names "priviledges".
