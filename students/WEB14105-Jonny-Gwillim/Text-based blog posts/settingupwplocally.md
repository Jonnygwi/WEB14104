Setting up wordpress locally
---
[I used this guide](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP)

Setting up Wordpress locally was pretty straightforward if you have a guide on how to do it.

We had to create, a database on our localhost using MySQL and then, an account that would have access to this database. These would then be linked to Wordpress using their 5 minute installation. 

I encountered something that was not mentioned in the guide. We had to create an account that would have access to the database and to do this I just used common sense to work out where the accounts tab was, it happened to be names "privileges".
